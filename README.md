# Pie

A game development DSL, inspired by Yasuko Ohba's Ruby Kaigi talk and a late night coversaton with @knowtheory. Created by Sarah Allen with a little help from Chad Fowler.

This is very experimental and marginally useful. I don't think the spec works.

There is a sample in book.rb.  To use it:

    ruby book.rb

then go to:
    http://localhost:4567/ship
    http://localhost:4567/building
    http://localhost:4567/tower
