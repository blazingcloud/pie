# Pie

A game development DSL, inspired by Yasuko Ohba's Ruby Kaigi talk and a late night coversaton with @knowtheory. Created by Sarah Allen with a little help from Chad Fowler.

This is very experimental and marginally useful. Spec works, but coverage is meager. 

Pie requires Ruby 1.9, because it is so cool.

## Examples

### Book

There is a sample in book.rb.  To use it:

    ruby book.rb

then go to:
    http://localhost:4567/ship
    http://localhost:4567/building
    http://localhost:4567/tower

Someday there will be UI to change pages.

### Game

    ruby game.rb

then go to:
    http://localhost:4567/park

Follow links to wander around the game world.  Yes, that is all there is right now.
