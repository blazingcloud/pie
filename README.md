# Pie

A game development DSL, inspired by Yasuko Ohba's Ruby Kaigi talk and a late night conversation with @knowtheory, @wycats, @sarahmei and @ultrasaurus. 

Pie requires Ruby 1.9, because it is so cool.

## Examples



### Game

    pie game.pie

then go to:
    http://localhost:31415/park

Follow links to wander around the game world.  Yes, that is all there is right now.

### Book -- NOT WORKING YET

There is a sample in book.rb.  To use it:

    pie book.pie

then go to:
    http://localhost:31415/ship
    http://localhost:31415/building
    http://localhost:31415/tower

Someday there will be UI to change pages.

## Issues?

Bugs and features are tracked here: http://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/115060

If you are trying to develop a game or a book using pie and have a question, ask here: http://groups.google.com/group/pie-dev

## If you want to help improve pie itself...

I want to try to resist adding any new features until we have no bugs and kid-friendly error messages.  Help is welcome.  Feel free to fork and submit pull requests or join the google group http://groups.google.com/group/pie-cooks
